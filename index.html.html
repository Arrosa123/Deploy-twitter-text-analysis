   <h1>Text Sentiment Analysis by Ilan Prudhomme, Nayan Barhate, Arrosa Qayyum and Kiran Dave</h1>
   <p>
    The exponential growth of social media has brought with it an increasing propagation of hate speech and hate based propaganda. 
    Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristics 
    such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion. Online hate diffusion has now developed into 
    a serious problem and this has led to a number of international initiatives being proposed, aimed at qualifying the problem and 
    developing effective counter-measures. The aim of this project is to divide a message or text in to positive or negative and that 
    can help the social media sites to block the message. This kind of messages have such deep and negative effect on people. We are 
    also trying to show those effects through visual representation of the date we will gather (in process) - we sill show them in 
    tables and graphs to make it easy to understand for everyone.
